This repository was createtd to serve as a professional Governance, Risk, and Compliance Incident Review Series. Basically to analyze real-worldd security incidents from a policy and process perspective. Each review demonstrates how strong technical controls can be bypassed by humans' and process(s)' failures.

Methodology/Terminology:
I utilize the NIST Special Publication 800-53 security controls to identify and determine policy gaps and think of appropriate actionable, policy-level remediation strategies.
